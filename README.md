Hello,
This was my first data visualization project based on Flight data analysis of major citites in INDIA
This was primarily based on the analysis of the flights
   1) Ticket Price
   2) Class difference
   3) Number of stops of flight
   4) City with most flight
   5) Airline price difference

This was majorily a differenciate the flight data with other airlines

SOME OF THE INSIGHTS FROM THE ABOVE ANALYSIS

1) Economy class are cheaper then bussiness class
2) Vistara is most expensive airline to travel while AirAsia was the cheapest on average
3) The price of ticket also depend on the number of stops that flight takes
4) The fare price of major city remains same for a while cheapest economy ticket was from mumbai to hyderabad

    1)  Mumbai
    2)  Bangalore
    3)  Delhi
